Welcome to your first assembly lab assignment!
This lab will review some of the LC-3 commands you learned during lecture and labs.

You will be working in lab.asm; you will edit assembly files using any text editor (VSCode, Sublime, Atom, vim, emacs, Notepad).
This lab assignment has you filling in a bunch of small operations, many of which require one line of code.
Each operation is preceded with an explanation of what you need to write.
It is recommended to have the textbook's Appendix A open while you work (see Canvas Files/LC3 Resources).

To grade your lab assignment, run grade.sh.
Mac/Linux users will need to have Docker running; Windows users will need to run the command in Git Bash (using the modern Docker setup) or Docker Quickstart Terminal (using the legacy setup).
The autograder checks the program as a whole, so you will need to fill all blanks first.
The grader usually tells you what is wrong: for example, if one of your registers contains the wrong value, it will tell you.
If you get a Malformed Instruction error, that likely means your code did not terminate and ran some garbage instructions. To resolve that, fill in the very last operation.
If you are confused by any other autograder error, please ask about it on Piazza.

You can use complx (a program available in the Docker container) to step through your code line-by-line; this may help diagnose errors.

When the autograder says PASSED, your lab assignment is complete.

Good luck!
